### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

USE_CSV_INPUT=false  # Set to true to use urls.csv
```

### CSV Input (Optional)

If you want to index specific URLs, create `urls.csv`:

```csv
https://example.com
https://example.com/about
https://example.com/contact
```

Then set `USE_CSV_INPUT=true` in your `.env` file.

### URL History

The tool automatically maintains an `indexed-urls.json` file that tracks all previously indexed URLs. This allows you to:
- Skip already indexed URLs
- Re-index only specific URLs
- Keep track of your indexing history

The file is created automatically on first run.
